# ✨ Dashboard Layout Generator - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What's New

The **dashboard_config** tool has been enhanced with intelligent layout generation capabilities!

### New Features Added

#### 1. **Device-Specific Layouts** 📱💻📲🖥️
Generate optimized dashboards for:
- **Mobile** - Single column, large touch targets, essential controls
- **Desktop** - Multi-column grids, history graphs, detailed monitoring
- **Tablet** - 2-3 columns, landscape optimized, perfect for wall mounting
- **Wall Panel** - Large displays, at-a-glance info, minimal interaction

#### 2. **Smart Prioritization** 🎯
Organize your dashboard by:
- **Most Used** - Frequently accessed entities at the top
- **By Area** - Room-by-room organization (living room, bedroom, etc.)
- **By Type** - Group similar devices (all lights, all climate, etc.)
- **Custom** - You define the exact priority

#### 3. **Usage Pattern Analysis** 📊
- Analyze entity usage over 7-14 days
- Identify most frequently used controls
- Discover usage patterns by time of day
- Get optimization recommendations
- Data-driven dashboard decisions

#### 4. **Layout Optimization** 🔧
- Convert existing dashboards for different devices
- Automatic column adjustments
