# Security Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Version**: 1.0.2  
**Auditor**: Automated Security Review  

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **PASSED** - No "phone home" functionality detected  
✅ **PASSED** - No telemetry or analytics code found  
✅ **PASSED** - All network calls properly scoped to Home Assistant instance  

This audit confirms that the Home Assistant MCP server does not collect, transmit, or report any data to external services. All network communication is limited to the user's configured Home Assistant instance.

---

## Audit Scope

### Files Audited
- All TypeScript source files in `src/`
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `.env.example`)
- Network communication code
- External dependencies

### Methodology
1. Static code analysis for network calls
2. Dependency vulnerability scanning
3. Pattern matching for telemetry/analytics keywords
4. Manual code review of critical paths

---

## Network Call Analysis

### All `fetch()` Calls Documented

| File | Line | Destination | Purpose |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| `src/hass/index.ts` | 45 | `${HASS_HOST}/api/*` | Home Assistant API calls |
| `src/health-check.ts` | 3 | `http://localhost:3000/health` | Local health check |
| `src/tools/control.tool.ts` | 181 | `${HASS_HOST}/api/services/*` | Device control |
| `src/tools/automation-config.tool.ts` | 351+ | `${HASS_HOST}/api/config/*` | Automation management |
| `src/tools/addon.tool.ts` | 37, 102 | `${HASS_HOST}/api/hassio/*` | Add-on management |
| `src/tools/package.tool.ts` | 33, 78 | `${HASS_HOST}/api/hacs/*` | HACS package management |

### Verdict

✅ **All network calls target user-configured Home Assistant instance only**

- No calls to external analytics services
- No calls to telemetry endpoints
- No calls to third-party APIs (except user's HA instance)
- All requests authenticated with user's `HASS_TOKEN`

## Dependency Analysis

### Security-Sensitive Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| `helmet` | ^7.1.0 | Security headers | ✅ Low (security tool) |
| `sanitize-html` | ^2.15.0 | XSS prevention | ✅ Low (security tool) |
| `jsonwebtoken` | ^9.0.2 | JWT auth | ⚠️ Medium (crypto) |
| `express-rate-limit` | ^7.5.0 | Rate limiting | ✅ Low (security tool) |
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | ^0.39.0 | AI SDK | ℹ️ Not actively used |
| `openai` | ^4.83.0 | AI SDK | ℹ️ Not actively used |

### Notable Findings

1. **@anthropic-ai/sdk** and **openai** packages are installed but not actively imported or used in the codebase
   - No evidence of API calls to Anthropic or OpenAI services
   - Likely included for future development or examples
   - Recommendation: Consider removing if not needed to reduce attack surface

2. **fastmcp** (^1.21.0) - MCP framework used for stdio transport
   - Open source, actively maintained
   - No known security issues

3. All security-focused packages are legitimate and widely used

## Code Pattern Analysis

### Checked Patterns (No Matches Found)

❌ `analytics`  
❌ `telemetry`  
❌ `tracking`  
❌ `posthog`  
❌ `segment`  
❌ `mixpanel`  
❌ `amplitude`  
❌ `google-analytics`  
❌ Suspicious environment variable uploads  
❌ Base64 encoded external URLs  

### Security Headers Implementation

✅ Helmet.js configured with security headers:
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Token Security

✅ **Properly Implemented**
- Home Assistant token required (`HASS_TOKEN`)
- Bearer token authentication on all API calls
- Tokens never logged or exposed
- JWT support for HTTP transport (optional)

### Environment Variables

Sensitive data properly managed:
```
HASS_TOKEN=<redacted>
HASS_HOST=<user-configured>
JWT_SECRET=<optional>
```

## Appendix: How to Verify

Users can verify these claims by:

1. **Search the codebase**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "fetch\|axios\|http" src/ --include="*.ts"
   ```

2. **Run network monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Use tcpdump, Wireshark, or similar to monitor traffic
   # Should only see connections to your HASS_HOST
   ```

   - All source code is available on GitHub
   - No obfuscation or minification in source
   - Transparent and auditable

4. **Check dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm list --all
   npm audit
