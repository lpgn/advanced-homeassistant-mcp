## üéØ Priority Modes

### Most Used
**Analyzes usage patterns** to place frequently accessed entities at the top.

**How it works:**
1. Tracks entity interaction frequency
2. Calculates daily averages
3. Identifies top 5-10 most used
4. Places them in prominent positions
5. Creates "Favorites" view

**Example:**
```
‚≠ê Favorites (Most Used)
1. Light - Living Room (245 uses/week)
2. Climate - Bedroom (168 uses/week)
3. Switch - Coffee Maker (147 uses/week)
4. Light - Kitchen (134 uses/week)
5. Media Player - Living Room TV (98 uses/week)
```

**Best for:** 
- Busy households
- Optimizing daily routines
- Reducing navigation time

---

### By Area
**Groups entities by physical location** for logical home navigation.

**How it works:**
1. Identifies all areas/rooms
2. Groups entities by location
3. Creates views or sections per area
4. Includes area-specific automations

**Example Views:**
- üè† Living Room
- üõèÔ∏è Bedroom
- üç≥ Kitchen
- üöø Bathroom
- üè° Outdoor

**Best for:**
- Multi-room homes
- Room-by-room control
- Logical navigation flow
- Family members managing specific areas

---

### By Type
**Organizes by device category** for bulk control and similar device management.

**How it works:**
1. Groups all lights together
2. Groups all climate devices
3. Groups all media players
4. Separate views per type

**Example Views:**
- üí° All Lights
- üå°Ô∏è All Climate Controls
- üì∫ All Media Players
- üîí All Security Devices
- üîå All Switches & Plugs

**Best for:**
- Managing similar devices
- Bulk operations (all lights off)
- Power users
- Device-specific settings

---

### Custom
**You define the priority** with flexible arrangement and mixed groupings.

**How it works:**
1. Specify exact entity order
2. Define custom groupings
3. Mix priorities as needed
4. Create specialized views

**Example Custom Priorities:**
- Morning routine entities first
- Security devices prominent
- Energy monitoring central
- Guest-friendly controls

**Best for:**
- Specific workflows
- Unique home layouts
- Special requirements
- Advanced users

## üéØ Tips & Tricks

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `generate_smart_layout`, then customize
2. **Test on Target Device**: Always test on the actual device type
3. **Use Analysis**: Run `analyze_usage_patterns` first for data-driven decisions
4. **Iterate**: Generate, test, adjust, regenerate
5. **Save Multiple Versions**: Create device-specific dashboards
6. **Use Badges Wisely**: Great for status, but don't overuse
7. **Leverage Conditionals**: Show/hide cards based on conditions
8. **Group Logically**: Related entities should be together
9. **Consider Guests**: Make guest-friendly dashboards
10. **Document Custom**: Use markdown cards to explain custom setups

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Doesn't Look Right on Mobile
‚Üí Use `optimize_for_device` with device_type: "mobile"

### Too Much Information
‚Üí Switch priority to "most-used" and reduce areas

### Hard to Read from Distance
‚Üí Use device_type: "wall-panel" for larger elements

### Slow Loading
‚Üí Reduce history_graph hours_to_show to 24 or less

### Entities Not Found
‚Üí Replace placeholder entity IDs with your actual IDs
